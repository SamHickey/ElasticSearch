# elasticsearch
 A simple web app to query a document using elasticsearch

# elasticsearch/mysite/search/views.py will read data off of the HTML page and send it to the corresponding search function
# it also queries the ES document to send information about the document to the HTML page such as number of documents.
# so as not to hard-code parameters from the medical document into the web app, views.py will also get information from the document and
# then send that to the HTML page. It does this for the intents.name.


# elasticsearch/mysite/search/es_call.py uses the elasticsearch_dsl api to query the "medical" document.
# Currently there are several different functions to query different parameters of the document ie intents.name, text etc.

# elasticsearch/mysite/search/templates/search/index.html contains the html file which is rendered.
